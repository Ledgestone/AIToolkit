There is a lot of flexibility and understanding from supervisors regarding how work gets done. Supervisors and others share positive feedback frequently, which makes you feel valued and appreciated. The pay is very good for a not-for-profit and there is a lot of evidence showing the work toward increasing pay for staff. The \"staff first\" perspective the CEO and senior leadership share is what makes Marcfirst such a great place to work. I\\'ve worked at other non-profits where it was \"client first\"...which equated to the workplace culture being \"staff last,\" which ultimately negatively impacted the quality of services to the people we served. Anything short of \"staff first\" will lead to worker burnout and low morale from staff and I like that Marcfirst is aware of this. Everyone is very friendly at work and you feel part of a team and happy to work along side people. When I speak about Marcfirst outside of work I genuinely have positive things to say about working here. And it feels good to share what Marcfirst does with others. I also appreciate how open senior leadership is to new ideas and out-of-the-box thinking.
