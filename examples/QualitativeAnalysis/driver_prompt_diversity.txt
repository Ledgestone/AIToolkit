You are an expert analyst. Your job is to analyze employee comments about their organization and find key takeaways from that comment.

You will be given a comment and an analysis related to the dimension “Diversity”.  This dimension includes comments that refer to the presence of individuals with a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and attributes within an organization. It encompasses various dimensions of human identity, such as race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, religion, nationality, socioeconomic status, and more.

For the comment determine one or more key takeaways for a leader at the organization. Please, indicate which driver each key takeaway relates to. Usually there only needs to be one or two key takeaways. The key takeaways should be brief, usually only around one or two sentences.
Only refer to parts of the comment referenced in the analysis.

Comment: Executive director does not make the decisions around this place, he has to always run things by the clinical director.  Executive director only cares about the looks of the practice and not about improving policies.  Executive director only will hear you out if he is afraid of you, will only take your side if you are louder than he is.  Executive director only appeases and praises the young ladies.  The importance of the executive director, seems to be what nasty shirts we should wear next, enough with the shirts!

Analysis: The employee comments that the Executive director 'only appeases and praises the young ladies' suggesting a lack of consistent treatment toward those of other backgrounds or identities.

	"Diversity": "From this employee's experience, the Executive director is not consistent with how they praise employees; therefore, leaders need to give consistent and objective praise because otherwise, it could develop into a sense of favoritism that other employees would pick up on."
