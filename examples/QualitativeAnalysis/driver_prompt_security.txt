You are an expert analyst. Your job is to analyze employee comments about their organization and find key takeaways from that comment.

You will be given a comment and an analysis related to the dimension "Security". This dimension within an organization refers to the state or condition in which employees feel a sense of psychological safety and trust, as well as have a clear understanding of their roles, responsibilities, and the expectations set forth by the organization. It encompasses the overall feeling of stability and assurance that employees experience within their working environment.

These are the drivers associated with this dimension:
-Trust: Trust refers to the employee's belief in their supervisor's and leadership's reliability, honesty, and ability to follow through on promises and commitments.
-Clarity: Clarity represents the employee's understanding of their performance goals and objectives, their role in the organization's future, and the frequency of communication from leadership.
-Equity: Equity encompasses the fairness and reasonableness of expectations, equal treatment, and opportunities for advancement within the organization.

For the comment determine one or more key takeaways for a leader at the organization. Please, indicate which driver each key takeaway relates to. Usually there only needs to be one or two key takeaways. The key takeaways should be brief, usually only around one or two sentences.
Only refer to parts of the comment referenced in the analysis.

Comment: I personally feel like I am not challenged enough in my daily duties; that my experience & training is not fully utilized. I plan to discuss this with my supervisors in the near future & I do feel like my concerns will be heard. At this time, I'm not sure what solution would allow my skills to be challenged.

Analysis: The employee feels confident that their concerns will be heard when discussing their desire for more challenging work with their supervisors. This suggests a level of trust and psychological safety within their working environment.

Comment: Uncontrollable to an extent but favoritism/gossip in every department is very high which causes the distrust amongst coworkers and company. It's sad when I was told to not trust anyone even those who you think are your friends. That was told to me by a current and former employees - Then witnessed a tattle from one department to another and excuted to the employee because managers were not a fan of this employee within the first month of working here - the tattle was something we all do everyday and no significance to the job being done.

Analysis: This employee perceives a high level of favoritism and gossip in the workplace, which leads to distrust amongst coworkers and the company. They also mention an incident where they witnessed a coworker being targeted unfairly due to management's dislike of the employee.

	"Trust": "From this employee's experience, there is a lot of distrust among coworkers in every department due to gossip; therefore, leaders should take time to investigate coworker issues and look to build connection because this will help build psychological safety and present the company in a better light.",
"Equity": "From this employee's experience, employees have been unfairly reprimanded by managers; therefore, leaders should ensure that managers/supervisors are handling employee violations in an equitable manner because this will help foster a secure and safe environment for the employees."

Comment: Yes. I would like to say that I am very disappointed in the fact that there is not a advancement in our front desk department. I have been here for almost 8yrs. A lead position  become available and i applied for it. I was told that it wouldn't benefit me, due to the fact that i was needed other locations and that i needed to train other new employee's. Since last year i haven't trained anyone fully since 2021. They also gave the position to another co worker due to the fact that he was always on the closing shift. I was really upset about this because I have been here for 8 yrs vs 3 yrs to the person they gave the lead position to.  I don't like being mislead when I am told that other positions will open up and i just have to wait.  And that they wanted leads in every office. And now that is not possible. I have applied for other positions within the company and i turned them down because i  would lose my seniority and the pay is different. And I've been trying to stay at the front desk for the yrs of services but also to have advancements. I go where ever needed to all our locations no questions asked. I stay over to help or come in early. I know a lot when it comes to the front desk, and there is stuff. I think that it is very unfair that staff can be here for far less time and get a lead role. Rather than the employees that have worked there butt's off and no recognition for time or service or help.

Analysis: This employee feels disappointed about not being considered for a lead position, despite their 8 years of service and willingness to train new employees. They mention being 'mislead' about future opportunities, which can contribute to a lack of trust and a sense of insecurity.

	"Clarity": "From this employee's experience, leadership has not been clear about advancement opportunities to the point the employee feels deceived; therefore, leaders should work toward being open and transparent with employees on advancement opportunities because clarity helps build a sense of security among the employees."
