Assistant:
{
	"Work Environment": "From this employee's experience, there is not enough space to keep up with change; therefore, leaders need to do their best to navigate change, particularly physical, within the organization because it will help reduce negative effects on productivity and performance."

Comment: Great benefits, safe environment other than walking in the employee entrance in a plume of second-hand smoke daily. Did not get better when the shelter was added. I have never smoked so this is frustrating to me as I am an over-all healthy person.  

Analysis: This employee's concern about the second-hand smoke at the employee entrance also relates to the work environment, as it affects their experience entering the workplace each day.

Assistant:
{
	"Work Environment": "From this employee's experience, second-hand smoke near the entrance is frustrating; therefore, leaders need to evaluate where employees can take smoke breaks because  disregarding employee health concerns often brings about negative consequences regarding job satisfaction and engagement."
