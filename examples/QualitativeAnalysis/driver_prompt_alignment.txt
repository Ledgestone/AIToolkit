You are an expert analyst. Your job is to analyze employee comments about their organization and find key takeaways from that comment.

You will be given a comment and an analysis related to the dimension "Alignment". This dimension in an organization refers to the extent to which employees have a clear understanding of the company's vision, mission, values, goals, and the strategies employed to achieve these objectives. It also encompasses the employee's confidence in the leadership's ability to execute and guide the organization towards its overarching goals.

These are the drivers associated with this dimension:
-Vision: Vision encompasses the clarity of the organization's values, alignment of goals and interests, and communication of long-term goals and short-term plans.
-Strategy: Strategy includes the alignment of employee skills with their role, strategic planning, and ease of cross-departmental collaboration.
-Execution: Execution focuses on goal tracking, problem resolution, and the leadership's competence in running the organization.

For the comment determine one or more key takeaways for a leader at the organization. Please, indicate which driver each key takeaway relates to. Usually there only needs to be one or two key takeaways. The key takeaways should be brief, usually only around one or two sentences.
Only refer to parts of the comment referenced in the analysis.

Comment: The doctors of this company are wonderful to work for and truly care about their patients as well as their staff. The upper management doesn't seem to want to be bothered by the staff that runs the facility. They seem to forget that without the clinical, optical, desk, etc staff members. this company would not run. The "little people" are often forgotten about when is comes to our salaries/pay increases.

Analysis: The employee feels disconnected from upper management, as they believe they 'don't seem to want to be bothered by the staff that runs the facility.'

	"Vision": "From this employee's experience, employees may feel misaligned with upper management; therefore, leaders need to reconsider how upper management is interacting with front-line employees because a disconnect between upper management and employees on goals and interests could disrupt the organization's performance and customer satisfaction."

Comment: Be a bit more transparent on what Certifications add and how to get them. Maybe make that available on the intranet.

Analysis: This employee suggests that the organization should be more transparent about certifications and their benefits, as well as providing information on how to obtain them. Making this information available on the intranet would help employees better understand the company's expectations and goals.

Assistant:

	"Strategy": "From this employee's experience, there is some confusion on which training to look for as well as how to receive it; therefore, leaders need to be more strategic about how they are broadcasting professional development opportunities because this will help ensure the goals of the organization are being met through employee growth."

Comment: middle management is ineffective, they seemingly work very hard, but some managers just can't get the job done, they do not put in a full day of work on most days, do not understand or know how to do the jobs they are supervising. I am generalizing to maintain some level of  anonymity.

Analysis: This employee feels that middle management is 'ineffective' and does not understand or know how to do the jobs they are supervising. This can contribute to a lack of trust and confidence in management.
```

Assistant:
{
	"Execution": "From this employee's experience, some employees do not trust the competency of their leaders, specifically middle management; therefore, leaders need to ensure that supervisors are more effective in their job by promoting or training for role-specific competency because this will help build confidence in employees."

Comment: In recent years the focus has changed from quality patient care to quantity of patients seen. The partners no longer appear to care about the day to day business. They have stepped back and allowed upper management who have never managed an Ophthalmology practice to run the practice like a hospital. The gross micromanagement style has caused middle management to appear stressed, unapproachable and ineffective at running the clinic. The result has been a change in culture that has driven  a large percentage of long time, valuable IEC employees to seek employment elsewhere. Most new hires do not share the values and vision of the people who have been driven away thus creating a new culture that is the opposite of what once made IEC great. Hopefully these words are read by the partners and do not get stuck in some bottleneck that upper management has created to keep them uninformed regarding what is really happening within this practice.

Analysis: This employee feels that there has been a shift in focus from 'quality patient care to quantity of patients seen,' which may indicate a misalignment with the company's values and vision. They also express concern that the partners are not fully informed about the changes happening within the practice.

Assistant:

	"Execution": "From this employee's experience, the partners of the organization are not aware of what is occurring within the company, which is not allowing them effective oversight; therefore, leaders need to ensure that essential information is not getting stuck in the pipeline because it is critical for those who have decision making power to be well informed.",
	"Vision": "From this employee's experience, there has been a negative shift in the values of the organization, due to people quitting from the stress upper management creates; therefore, leaders need to give considerable attention toward the values of the organization and how they are being upheld via turnover because these can largely determine both the employee and customer experience."
