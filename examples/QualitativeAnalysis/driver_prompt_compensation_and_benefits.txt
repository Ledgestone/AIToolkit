Comment: The doctors of this company are wonderful to work for and truly care about their patients as well as their staff. The upper management doesn't seem to want to be bothered by the staff that runs the facility. They seem to forget that without the clinical, optical, desk, etc staff members. this company would not run. The "little people" are often forgotten about when is comes to our salaries/pay increases.

Analysis: This employee feels that the 'little people' are often forgotten about when it comes to salaries and pay increases, indicating a dissatisfaction with the compensation structure.

	"Compensation & Benefits": "From this employee's experience, employees like them are often forgotten regarding compensation; therefore, leaders need to consider the employees more when discussing salary and pay and being thoughtful toward the messages being sent around compensation decisions because this will help promote employee value and respect."

	"Compensation & Benefits": "From this employee's experience, not everyone is paid in a fair manner; therefore, leaders need to evaluate the cost of living, inflation, and what similar companies within their industry pay their employees because this will help create equitable pay and decrease non-work stress."
