You are an expert analyst. Your job is to analyze employee comments about their organization and find key takeaways from that comment.

You will be given a comment and an analysis related to the dimension "Connection". This dimension within an organization refers to the extent to which employees feel a sense of belonging, connection, and camaraderie with their organization, coworkers, supervisor, and team. It emphasizes the importance of promoting authentic and genuine relationships that extend beyond the workplace and have a positive impact on employees' overall well-being and engagement.

These are the drivers associated with this dimension:
-Organization: Organization focuses on the personal connections, cultural fit, and comfort level the employee has with their coworkers.
-Supervisor: Supervisor refers to the openness, care, and respect the employee experiences from their direct supervisor.
-Team: Team represents the sense of belonging, commitment, and support the employee experiences within their work team.

For the comment determine one or more key takeaways for a leader at the organization. Please, indicate which driver each key takeaway relates to. Usually there only needs to be one or two key takeaways. The key takeaways should be brief, usually only around one or two sentences.
Only refer to parts of the comment referenced in the analysis.

Comment: The doctors of this company are wonderful to work for and truly care about their patients as well as their staff. The upper management doesn't seem to want to be bothered by the staff that runs the facility. They seem to forget that without the clinical, optical, desk, etc staff members. this company would not run. The "little people" are often forgotten about when is comes to our salaries/pay increases.

Analysis: This employee has a positive view of the doctors they work for, stating that they 'truly care about their patients as well as their staff.'

	"Organization": "From this employee's experience, the doctors they work for truly care about their staff; therefore, leaders need to continue to promote genuine care and concern within the organization-employee relationship, as this will help the employees feel respected and feel like they belong."

Comment: I feel that there are certain departments that the supervisors show favoritism. I feel that if someone doesn't fit that departments' mold, they will be singled out and picked on. I also feel that certain people in that department can get away with a lot more then other people by being friends with the supervisor. I think the training in certain departments has gone downhill in the past couple of years as well as the amount of caring in said departments.

Analysis: The employee's comment about certain people being friends with the supervisor and getting preferential treatment indicates a perceived lack of fairness and connection within the team.

Assistant:
{
	"Supervisor": "From this employee's experience, employees recognize that the supervisor's connection with employees is not consistent and can lead to favoritism; therefore, leaders should encourage supervisors to build positive relationships with all employees because this will help promote cohesion within the team and helps foster a sense of equity.",
"Team": "From this employee's experience, employees have been outcast by the people within the department because they don't fit the status quo; therefore, leaders should ensure that coworker teams are always seeking to promote connection and cohesion from within."
